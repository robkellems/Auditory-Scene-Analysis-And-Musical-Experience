# Auditory-Scene-Analysis-And-Musical-Experience
Data and R code for my research project "Auditory Scene Analysis and Musical Experience". This experiment took place in Fall 2021 as part of my final research project for COGS-Q370 Experiments and Models in Cognition.

"code.R" contains the code which I wrote in order to analyze the data and create the figures used in the paper.
"responses.csv" contains the data itself.
